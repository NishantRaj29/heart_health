# Heart_Disease_Prediction

We have design the Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning with python.Here we have used the Logistic Regression model.

## Dataset
The model is trained using the dataset of form CSV file, which consist of details of various patient related to heart and some details of normal people to
deeply understand what parameters makes difference in healthy and defective heart.


## Technologies Used
The following libraries have been used in the implementation of this model:

1. Numpy
2. Panda
3. Logistic Regression

## Implementation

We start with the data exploration and analysis.Then select the relevant feature for feature selection such as age,sex,cholestrol level.Then study what parameters
influence our heart directly and on the basis of that we are predicting whether the person is prone to heart related issues in future.
